        <h1>DRAFT REPORT: Total Wage Theft in the Jurisdiction of  San Jose for Construction Industry</h1> 

<p>These data are a combination of the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement Wage Claim Adjudications,                 the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement Wage Claim Adjudications,                     and the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement judgments. The WHD data were obtained from the DOL , and the  DLSE data pre-2020 were obtained through a Section 6250 CA Public Records Act request                        (does not include purged cases which are those settled and then purged typically after three years),                        and then post-2020 DLSE data are from the CA DIR websearch portal.</p>
<p>The dataset in this report is pulled from a larger dataset that for all regions and sources contains  unknown number of  cases. This is approximately a <p>The total Federal WHD dataset goes back to 2000 , and  total State DLSE dataset goes back to 2000 (Note: The State purged old closed cases and thus the above is an imperfect ratio).</p><p> These data are internally incomplete, and do not include private lawsuits, stop notices, and complaints to the awarding agency, contractor, employment department, licensing board, and district attorney. Therefore, the following is a sample given the above data constraints and the reluctance by populations to file wage and hour claims.</p>

<h1> Notes and methods summary</h1> 
<p> Report generated 07/23/2025</p> 
<p>Palo Alto Data Group pulled a list from databases of all sector judgments and adjudications         to generate this report using an open source software that was prepared by the Center for Integrated Facility Engineering (CIFE)         at Stanford University in collaboration with the Santa Clara County Wage Theft Coalition. These data         have not been audited and, therefore, are only intended as an indication of wage theft.</p> 
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>(1) In the tables and city summaries, the zip ####X represents data that is missing the zip code field. (2) There are unlabeled industries, many of these are actually construction, care homes, restaurants, etc. just there is not an ability to label them as such--a label of 'other' could lead one to indicate that they are not these industries and therefore the category of 'undefined.' (3) Values may deviate by 10% within the report for camparable subcategories: this is due to labeling and relabeling of industry that may overwrite a previous industry label (for example Nail Hamburger could be labeled service or food). </p>
<p>Note that categorizations are based on both documented data and intelligent inferences, therefore, there are errors.
